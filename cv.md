3. In 2020, I completed my master's degree in Applied Informatics.\
After that, he was selected for the last stage in [School 21](https://21-school.ru/) in Moscow (School 42 franchise). On 09/16/2020 I am waiting for the results, after which they will inform me whether I entered the basic training or not. Must be after 09/19/20.
While studying at the university, I participated in two hackathons - SAP Code Challenge Enterprise for ios and Uni-Digit PGUPS Hackhaton in October and November 2018, respectively.
I have no experience in IT.
The IT sphere is very sympathetic to me and after school 21 I am not going to stop there.
Of my own qualities, I can note perseverance, fairly quick learning and the desire to learn something new every day. If I fail to enter school 21, I will continue to study in this direction.
